    <h1>WHAT IS A SYSTEMATIC LITERATURE REVIEW</h1>
    <p>A Systematic Literature Review(SLR) about a particular subject provides the foundation for supporting a research. The increase of information in every discipline is available and the easy access to such information in electronic databases has given rise to the significant advancement of systematic review studies. The traditional research methods face the difficulty of reading all available articles and research papers and prioritizing them according to their relevance manually. Systematic literature reviews therefore aim to address these problems by identifying, critically evaluating and integrating the findings of all relevant, either quality wise or quantity wise, individual studies addressing to one or more than one research questions. On the grounds of this, we propose a solution that is, to automate the Systematic Literature Review process to facilitate researchers where they can focus on synthesizing the data instead of being busy in the mechanical work of data retrieval, inclusion and exclusion and quality assessment.</p>
